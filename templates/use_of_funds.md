## Template: Working Capital Focus

Grant funding would provide crucial working capital for MARV Media during our growth phase:

**Operational Stability**
- Cover 3-6 months of fixed costs while building client base
- Eliminate cash flow constraints that limit marketing investments
- Enable competitive pricing to win initial clients

**Growth Investment**
- Redirect current revenue to marketing and business development
- Fund longer-term initiatives (SEO, content marketing) that require time to mature
- Support client onboarding costs before recurring revenue begins

**Risk Mitigation**
- Maintain financial runway during economic uncertainty
- Build reserve for opportunity investments (e.g., strategic partnerships)

As an early-stage company with under $100,000 in revenue, working capital is our most critical need. This funding would provide the stability to focus on growth rather than survival.
